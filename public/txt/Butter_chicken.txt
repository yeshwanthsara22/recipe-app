=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
Marinate the Chicken
Prepare the marinade: In a bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt.
Add the chicken: Mix well, cover, and let it marinate for at least 1-2 hours (overnight in the fridge is better for deeper flavor).
Cook the Chicken
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan or grill pan over medium heat.
Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until golden brown on all sides (about 6-8 minutes). You don't need to cook them all the way through, as they'll finish cooking in the sauce later. Set aside.
Prepare the Butter Chicken Gravy
Cook onions: In the same pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
Add ginger-garlic paste and spices: Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Sauté until the raw smell disappears (2-3 minutes). Then, add cumin powder, coriander powder, and red chili powder. Stir well.
Tomato puree: Add the tomato puree and cook for about 10 minutes, until the oil starts to separate from the sauce.
Blend (Optional): For a smooth gravy, you can blend the mixture at this stage using an immersion blender or transfer it to a mixer. This step gives the butter chicken its signature silky texture.
Combine Chicken and Gravy
Add the grilled chicken pieces to the gravy. Stir to coat the chicken in the sauce.
Add a cup of water (or adjust as per the consistency you want) and bring it to a simmer. Let it cook for 10-15 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and the flavors meld together.
Finishing Touches
Add cream: Stir in the cream and let the gravy simmer for another 3-5 minutes.
Kasuri methi: Sprinkle the crushed kasuri methi (fenugreek leaves) and garam masala powder. Mix well and adjust salt.
If you like a hint of sweetness, add a tablespoon of sugar.
Serve
Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and a drizzle of cream.
Serve hot with naan, rice, or roti.
