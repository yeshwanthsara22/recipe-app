=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
 Prepare the Chicken:
Clean and marinate the chicken pieces with a little salt, turmeric, and red chili powder. Set aside for about 15-20 minutes.
 Cook the Onions and Spices:
Heat oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, cloves, and cardamom pods. Fry for a few seconds until fragrant. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown.
 Add Ginger-Garlic Paste:
Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears.
Add Tomatoes and Spices:
Add the chopped or pureed tomatoes. Cook until the oil starts to separate from the mixture. Add turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and a little salt. Cook the spices for a minute or two.
Cook the Chicken:
Add the marinated chicken pieces and stir well to coat them with the spice mixture. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the chicken turns white and starts to release juices.
Simmer the Curry:
Add water (about 1-2 cups depending on how much gravy you want) and bring the curry to a boil. Lower the heat, cover, and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.
Add Coconut Milk/Yogurt (Optional):
If you want a creamier curry, stir in coconut milk or yogurt at this stage. Let it simmer for another 5 minutes.
Finish with Garam Masala:
Add garam masala powder and adjust salt as needed. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.
